# GMEE Research Protocol

**Results status: UNPERFORMED.** This is a protocol and contribution outline,
not a paper reporting completed experiments. Working endpoints, deterministic
fixtures, passing unit tests and pipeline throughput are engineering evidence;
they do not establish scientific novelty, improved accuracy or factual truth.
Historical `backend/eval_publication_report.md` is retained as **exploratory**,
not independent human-held-out validation. See [Evaluation](EVALUATION.md),
[Dataset](DATASET.md) and [Audit](AUDIT.md).

## Candidate contribution and scope

The research question is whether **typed, inspectable textual mutation evidence**
combined with **calibrated claim relatedness** improves analysis of reporting
changes over similarity-only retrieval, under independently annotated, frozen
cross-event evaluation. Potential contributions are:

1. A reproducible typed-change task (numeric drift, entity substitution,
   hedging/polarity/framing/wording changes and a no-change control), with changed
   spans and temporal provenance rather than an unlabeled cosine edge.
2. A claim-matching model evaluated and calibrated on authenticated human labels,
   including abstention/coverage instead of treating cosine as probability.
3. An auditable corpus-local evidence view: citations and passage-level stance,
   source/syndication grouping, explicit missing-coverage and model warnings.
4. An artifact protocol tying labels, event identity, frozen splits, method/model
   revisions, licensing and error analyses to a content-addressed snapshot.

These are **candidate contributions**; novelty requires a literature comparison
and experiments. Typed changes may reflect legitimate updates, corrections or
paraphrases, not misinformation. `EVOLVED_FROM` is inferred candidate lineage,
not observed copying, influence or a causal diffusion mechanism. Local evidence
agreement is not external fact verification. Calibrated **relatedness** is not a
probability that a claim is true, and no live verdict score is promoted to a
calibrated posterior merely because a calibration harness exists.

## Tasks must remain separate

| Task | Human target | What must not be substituted |
|------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| Relatedness | `SAME_STORY` / `EVOLVED` / `DISTINCT`, with a binary relatedness view reported separately | A cosine bucket or automatic label |
| Typed mutation | Independent multi-label change types + span evidence, orientation recorded | Binary relatedness success, high cosine or a word diff alone |
| Evidence stance | Supports / contradicts / neutral / unavailable for a cited passage | Outlet reputation, stylistic hedges or missing retrieval as contradiction |
| Selective claim matching | Correctness conditional on coverage / abstention | Calibration of factual truth or absence of evidence as falsehood |
| Propagation | External observation/attribution data, if ever collected | Publication order, graph adjacency or a simulation |

Do not conflate SAME_STORY and EVOLVED to claim mutation-detection accuracy.
Report binary retrieval and three-way labeling separately. Independent reporting
must not be inferred solely from different domains; syndication/canonical
content needs grouping and documented residual dependence.

## Predeclared hypotheses (not findings)

| ID | Hypothesis | Planned test / failure interpretation |
|----|------------|--------------------------------------|
| H1 | Typed checks add useful mutation discrimination beyond cosine | Held-out per-type/macro F1 and span error analysis against text/similarity baselines; null result is reportable |
| H2 | Learned calibration improves relatedness reliability | Dev-selected method evaluated once on untouched test using Brier, log loss and disclosed-bin ECE/reliability plots; no claim of truth calibration |
| H3 | Dedup/event constraints reduce false links and evidence inflation | Compare canonical/event-aware and unconstrained variants under identical data/splits; report errors on syndicated and temporally incompatible pairs |
| H4 | Abstention exposes rather than hides missing corpus coverage | Risk–coverage / precision–coverage curves and unavailable-model cases; no promised target coverage |
| H5 | Effects generalize beyond familiar events/outlets | Event-disjoint and chronological held-out evaluation, plus an optional predeclared source-held-out stress test |

Choose primary endpoints, uncertainty procedure, operating thresholds, stopping
rule and smallest practically relevant effect **before** examining test labels.
Sample-size planning depends on event dependence, class/type support and desired
precision/power, not a magic minimum label count. Hypotheses may fail; report all
registered comparisons and limitations rather than selectively advertising wins.

## Baselines and ablations

Use the same immutable records, train/dev/test identity and compute budget for
all methods; record tokenizer and model revisions. Planned baseline families:

- Majority/label-prior and simple random/constant-score controls.
- Token overlap and word/character TF-IDF cosine; fit vocabulary/IDF on train.
- BM25 retrieval with train-derived index/parameters where the retrieval task
  and candidate universe are explicitly defined.
- Frozen all-mpnet-base-v2 cosine with a dev-selected threshold (raw similarity,
  not probability); consider an independent off-the-shelf NLI/stance baseline.
- A simple supervised relatedness model using predeclared text/entity/time
  features, plus train-fitted probability calibration selected on dev.
- A transparent typed text-change analyzer versus similarity-only and untyped
  diff controls, scored only where independently annotated mutation gold exists.

Planned ablations remove one factor at a time: numeric/entity typing,
hedging/polarity/framing rules, timestamps/parent eligibility, canonical/source
independence grouping, stance, calibration and abstention. Compare a
similarity-only model to one using typed features without using test gold or
sampling buckets as predictive labels. Report each feature's provenance and
which implementations actually ran; a documented baseline is not a result.

Any pretrained model or API may have contamination from public news training
corpora. Record known training/data overlap limits, unknowns and provider model
versions. Optional provider evaluation requires an explicit cost/privacy budget.
No browser dependency or remote research service is required by this protocol.

## Human annotation and automatic diagnostics

- Authenticated `/eval/next` serves blinded claim text/outlets only; no score,
  bucket, verdict, predicted type or model stance. The server assigns the
  annotator ID; a client handle is not provenance.
- Two or more distinct authenticated humans must independently review eligible
  pairs under a written rubric. Current conservative consensus requires all
  current human labels to agree; disagreement remains unresolved until a
  documented independent adjudication protocol exists. Agreement is descriptive,
  not proof of independence or correct labels.
- Mutation annotations require their own agreed type/spans protocol; do not
  derive mutation gold from the system being evaluated. Record missing type
  annotations separately from an explicitly empty type list.
- Preserve revisions, notes and provenance; distinguish `human`, `automatic`,
  `legacy`, `test`. Historical handle-only votes remain legacy, not silently
  authenticated. Deleted-user or inconsistent identity records cannot be
  promoted to human gold.
- Automatic NLI/entity/lexical votes support weak-label exploration/error
  triage only. In particular, annotators using cosine buckets or score-tuned
  thresholds can be circular. Different feature families do not prove
  statistical independence or equivalence to human annotators.
- Fixtures and scripted sweeps never create human labels in a live corpus.
  Automatic scripts must not write `origin=human`; diagnostics never overwrite
  or merge into human consensus.

Recruitment/training, annotator background, compensation/consent, workload,
per-class shared-pair counts and adjudication must be documented before release.
Report raw agreement plus appropriate kappa/alpha and uncertainty; shared errors
can yield high agreement. Gold quality and event identity require human review.

## Event identity, frozen splits and leakage prevention

1. Curate a stable event ID from externally reviewed event identity, not the
   current model's cluster assignment. Same named entity across different dates
   is not automatically the same event. Record event-policy revisions.
2. Canonicalize unordered pair identity. Keep duplicated/reversed historical
   pairs and their votes for audit, but use one canonical experimental record.
3. Group connected components sharing claims, articles, canonical/syndicated
   text or event identity. Assign the whole component to exactly one split;
   compare chronological/source stress splits only under a predeclared protocol.
4. Freeze train/dev/test assignments **before** fitting/calibration/threshold
   selection. `unassigned` is not a publication split; uncertainty-based next-pair
   selection is train-only, never an adaptive dev/test label-selection shortcut.
5. Fit vocabulary, model coefficients and calibrators on train, select method,
   hyperparameters, threshold and abstention policy on dev; touch test only for
   final predeclared evaluation. Never report a test-optimized best-F1 as an
   unbiased operating result.
6. Admin export captures a consistent snapshot with IDs, text hashes, votes,
   origin, event/split assignments and dataset version. Preserve exact bytes and
   checksum; later corpus growth or relabeling creates a new dataset version.
   Pair freeze alone does not prove texts/model weights remained unchanged.

Tests can reject structural cross-split overlap; they cannot prove independently
curated event IDs are semantically correct. Human inspection of event boundaries,
canonical grouping and label independence remains a release gate.

## Reproducibility and licensing manifest

Record repository revision **and dirty patch**, schema revisions (`gmee01` typed
edges, `gmee02` origins/splits, `gmee03` durable ownership), experiment/config hash,
immutable record hashes, dataset version, split/event manifest, model/tokenizer
revision hashes and licenses, Python/OS/hardware/library versions, random seeds,
training/calibration/threshold settings, candidate-retrieval universe, time
cutoff, warnings, missing-model handling and raw per-pair predictions. Container
image tags alone and RNG seeds are not complete reproducibility evidence.

Data release needs a per-source provenance/license inventory: canonical URL,
collection and publication times, content hash, API/RSS terms, permitted use,
redistribution permissions, takedown/retention and personal-data controls.
Repository MIT licensing applies to code, **not automatically news articles,
Reddit posts, annotations or model weights**. If full text cannot be redistributed,
release permitted IDs/URLs, derived features and a licensed acquisition protocol;
state which exact snapshots third parties cannot legally reproduce.

Keep sensitive account IDs/personal data out of public artifacts or pseudonymize
under an approved policy while preserving internal auditability. Coordinate
annotator consent and deletion obligations with the freeze/retention protocol.
No legal permission or privacy clearance is claimed by this document.

## Analysis and reporting plan

- Relatedness: per-class precision/recall/F1, macro F1, confusion matrix, AUROC
  and PR-AUC where both classes and sufficient event support exist.
- Calibration: Brier/log loss, ECE with disclosed bins, reliability plots;
  calibrated probabilities only for the defined human relatedness target.
- Mutation: per-type support and precision/recall/F1, macro and subset accuracy,
  span-grounding errors, corrections vs misinformation examples, missing gold.
- Retrieval/evidence: candidate recall under a labeled candidate universe,
  citation traceability, stance errors and risk–coverage/abstention curves.
- Uncertainty: event/component-level resampling to respect dependent pairs;
  report intervals, class/type support and missing/undefined metrics. Paired
  comparisons/multiple testing need a predeclared correction/interpretation.
- Stratified sampling: disclose inclusion probabilities and report both the
  sampled task and appropriate population-weighted estimates if justified.
  High-cosine-only sampling cannot establish general corpus performance.
- Efficiency: measured cold/warm wall time, CPU/RSS, model download/load costs,
  query/job budgets and hardware under the exact dataset; no claimed benchmark
  numbers until run. Engineering smoke deadlines are not performance results.

Error analysis should cover negation, numeric/unit shifts, entity identity,
hedging, legitimate updates/retractions, copied content, ambiguous timestamps,
non-English/code-switching, satire/quotations, corpus gaps and source dependence.
Release negative results and representative non-cherry-picked errors alongside
successes. No unperformed experiment gets a placeholder metric.

### Starting literature pointers (not a novelty comparison)

Sentence-BERT ([Reimers & Gurevych, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10084)),
probability calibration ([Guo et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04599)) and
FEVER ([Thorne et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05355)) provide relevant
retrieval/calibration/evidence tasks. A current literature review and direct
comparisons against appropriate temporal claim-change systems remain necessary.
